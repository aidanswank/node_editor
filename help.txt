# INSANELY STUPID BUILD PROCESSES # 23/9/22
first install two versions of homebrew, one for arm and one for x86_64
this is needed because in order to use most VST3, they need to be run under rosetta emulation

brow install cmake

git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
run:
!!!     this will fail but attempt to wrangle x86_64 versions of libraries needed      !!!
ib cmake -B build/ . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -GXcode
then rerun the command but without the "ib", I'm not sure why this works but I think arm version of cmake picks off where x86_64 version stopped?


this doesnt work vvvv
if not using xcode, to build with unix makefiles:
cmake --build build
